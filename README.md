# Image-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning-and-Customized-CNN-model
Classification of images pertaining to different background has been done with the help of
pre-trained VGG16 model and transfer learning technique. For the training of classifier, last
layer has been removed to add the customized class labels for the purpose of classification.
While to perform feature extraction, last four layers have been removed to add new layers
in place so that features can be extracted for further image classification.
